## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned


```html
 <div class="background">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="image-container"><img src="images\image-qr-code.png"></div>
      <div class="text-container"> <div class="text">
```      
```css
body,.background,.container,.image-container,.text-container{    
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In my future projects i would probably focus more Javascript and CSS cause i need to work on my css 

### Useful resources
- [Resource](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website that helped me when i had problems remembering some css properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept and anyone who need a quick recap on any concept.
